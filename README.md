# Apppye
Appye is a closed-source bookmarklet that allows you to use unblocked websites and games without them getting blocked.  
Currently, we only allow the use of our pre-packaged apps. Eventually, we will allow the creation & modifcations of apps.

<br />

Can't find a app you like? [Create an issue](https://github.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=app-game-request.md&title=%5BAPP%5D).<br />
(Make sure other websites have it, and that it is not on the [**BANNED LIST**](https://github.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/blob/main/BANNEDLIST.md))
## How to add:
First, go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/main/bookmarklet.js)

Next, press CTRL+A, then CTRL+C, then press CTRL+SHIFT+B two times.

Now, right click the bookmarklet bar, click "Add page..."

For the name, put whatever you want, it dose not matter.

For the URL, paste with CTRL+V.
Now, you should be able to use this on any site*, please read the docs embeded into your version.
##### *Some websites will **NOT** work with this. Most Desmos state calulators do work.*
