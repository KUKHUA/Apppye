# Apppye
Appye is a closed-source bookmarklet that allows you to use unblocked websites &amp; games without them getting blocked.<br />
Currently, we only allow the use of our pre-packaged apps, eventually, we will allow the creation & modifcations of apps.
<br />

Can't find a app you like? [Create a issue](https://github.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=app-game-request.md&title=%5BAPP%5D).<br />
(Make sure other websites have it, and that it is not on the [**BANNED LIST**](https://github.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/blob/main/BANNEDLIST.md))
## How to add:
First, go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/main/bookmarklet.js)
<br />
Next, press CTRL+A, then CTRL+C, then press CTRL+SHIFT+B two times.
<br />
Now, right click the bookmarklet bar, click "Add page..."
<br />
For the name, put whatever you want, it dose not matter.
<br />
For the URL, paste with CRTL+V
Now, you should be able to use this on any site*, please read the docs embeded into your version.
##### *Some websites will **NOT** work with this, most Desmos sate calulators do work though.*
