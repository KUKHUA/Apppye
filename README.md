# Appye

Appye is a closed-source bookmarklet that allows you to access unblocked websites and games without them getting blocked.

Currently, we only support the use of our pre-packaged apps. However, we have plans to allow the creation and modifications of apps in the future.

If you can't find an app you like, you can create an issue [here](https://github.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=app-game-request.md&title=%5BAPP%5D). Make sure the app is not on the [BANNED LIST](https://github.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/blob/main/BANNEDLIST.md) and is available on other websites.

## How to add Appye:

1. Go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUKHUA/Apppye/main/bookmarklet.js).

3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+B twice.
4. Right-click the bookmarklet bar and select "Add page..."
5. Choose a name for the bookmarklet (it doesn't matter what you put).
6. Paste the copied URL using CTRL+V.
7. You should now be able to use Appye on any site*.

Note: Some websites may not work with Appye. Most Desmos state calculators do work.
